**Market Performance (2018--2021) and Impact of Global Events**

From 2018 to 2021, the pet supplements market demonstrated steady growth
across global regions, driven by increased disposable income, greater
spending on pet care, and a shift toward preventive healthcare for
animals. However, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 introduced temporary
challenges due to supply chain disruptions and shifting consumer
priorities. Despite this, the market displayed resilience and quickly
rebounded, as pet adoption surged and consumers sought to maintain their
pets\' health during prolonged periods of remote work and isolation.

Further complicating the market environment was the geopolitical
instability stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war. This conflict impacted
global supply chains, raw material availability, and distribution
channels, leading to temporary pricing fluctuations and logistical
challenges. Nevertheless, the industry adapted through increased digital
sales and localized sourcing.
